title: CVE in org.hyperledger.fabric-sdk-java:fabric-sdk-java
description: >
    Multiple packages on Sun Solaris, including (1) NSS; (2) Java JDK and JRE 5.0 Update 8 and earlier, SDK and JRE 1.4.x up to 1.4.2_12, and SDK and JRE 1.3.x up to 1.3.1_19; (3) JSSE 1.0.3_03 and earlier; (4) IPSec/IKE; (5) Secure Global Desktop; and (6) StarOffice, when using an RSA key with exponent 3, removes PKCS-1 padding before generating a hash, which allows remote attackers to forge a PKCS #1 v1.5 signature that is signed by that RSA key and prevents these products from correctly verifying X.509 and other certificates that use PKCS #1.
