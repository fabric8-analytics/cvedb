title: CVE in org.ovirt.engine.sdk:ovirt-engine-sdk-java
description: >
    ovirt-engine-sdk-python before 3.4.0.7 and 3.5.0.4 does not verify that the hostname of the remote endpoint matches the Common Name (CN) or subjectAltName as specified by its x.509 certificate in a TLS/SSL session. This could allow man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof remote endpoints via an arbitrary valid certificate.
