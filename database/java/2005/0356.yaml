title: CVE in com.io7m.mutable.numbers:com.io7m.mutable.numbers.documentation
description: >
    Multiple TCP implementations with Protection Against Wrapped Sequence Numbers (PAWS) with the timestamps option enabled allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (connection loss) via a spoofed packet with a large timer value, which causes the host to discard later packets because they appear to be too old.
