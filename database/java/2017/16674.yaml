title: CVE in org.jmxtrans.agent:jmxtrans-agent
description: >
    Datto Windows Agent allows unauthenticated remote command execution via a modified command in conjunction with CVE-2017-16673 exploitation, aka an attack with a malformed primary whitelisted command and a secondary non-whitelisted command. This affects Datto Windows Agent (DWA) 1.0.5.0 and earlier. In other words, an attacker could combine this "primary/secondary" attack with the CVE-2017-16673 "rogue pairing" attack to achieve unauthenticated access to all agent machines running these older DWA versions.
