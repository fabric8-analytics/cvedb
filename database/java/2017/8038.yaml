title: CVE in io.pivotal.spring.cloud:spring-cloud-sso-connector
description: >
    In Cloud Foundry Foundation Credhub-release version 1.1.0, access control lists (ACLs) enforce whether an authenticated user can perform an operation on a credential. For installations using ACLs, the ACL was bypassed for the CredHub interpolate endpoint, allowing authenticated applications to view any credential within the CredHub installation.
