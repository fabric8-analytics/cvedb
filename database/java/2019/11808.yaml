title: CVE in io.ratpack:ratpack-gson
description: >
    Ratpack versions before 1.6.1 generate a session ID using a cryptographically weak PRNG in the JDK's ThreadLocalRandom. This means that if an attacker can determine a small window for the server start time and obtain a session ID value, they can theoretically determine the sequence of session IDs.
