title: CVE in org.jboss.eap.additional.testsuite:eap-additional-testsuite-source-distribution
description: >
    The implementations of SAE and EAP-pwd in hostapd and wpa_supplicant 2.x through 2.8 are vulnerable to side-channel attacks as a result of observable timing differences and cache access patterns when Brainpool curves are used. An attacker may be able to gain leaked information from a side-channel attack that can be used for full password recovery.
cvss_v2: 4.3
