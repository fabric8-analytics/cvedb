    Divisa Proxia Suite 9 < 9.12.16, 9.11.19, 9.10.26, 9.9.8, 9.8.43 and 9.7.10, 10.0 < 10.0.32, and 10.1 < 10.1.5, SparkSpace 1.0 < 1.0.30, 1.1 < 1.1.2, and 1.2 < 1.2.4, and Proxia PHR 1.0 < 1.0.30 and 1.1 < 1.1.2 allows remote code execution via untrusted Java deserialization. The proxia-error cookie is insecurely deserialized in every request (GET or POST). Thus, an unauthenticated attacker can easily craft a seria1.0lized payload in order to execute arbitrary code via the prepareError function in the com.divisait.dv2ee.controller.MVCControllerServlet class of the dv2eemvc.jar component. allows remote code execution via untrusted Java deserialization.
