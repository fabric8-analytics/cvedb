title: CVE in org.specs2:specs2_2.12
description: >
    An issue was discovered in AODDriver2.sys in AMD OverDrive. The vulnerable driver exposes a wrmsr instruction via IOCTL 0x81112ee0 and does not properly filter the Model Specific Register (MSR). Allowing arbitrary MSR writes can lead to Ring-0 code execution and escalation of privileges.
