description: >
    An unauthenticated Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) in Wicket Core in LogonBox Nervepoint Access Manager 2013 through 2017 allows a remote attacker to enumerate internal Active Directory usernames and group names, and alter back-end server jobs (backup and synchronization jobs), which could allow for the possibility of a Denial of Service attack via a modified jobId parameter in a runJob.html GET request.
