title: CVE in com.alipay.sofa:hessian
description: >
    ** DISPUTED ** SOFA-Hessian through 4.0.2 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands via a crafted serialized Hessian object because blacklisting of com.caucho.naming.QName and com.sun.org.apache.xpath.internal.objects.XString is mishandled, related to Resin Gadget. NOTE: The vendor doesn?t consider this issue a vulnerability because the blacklist is being misused. SOFA Hessian supports custom blacklist and a disclaimer was posted encouraging users to update the blacklist or to use the whitelist feature for their specific needs since the blacklist is not being actively updated.
