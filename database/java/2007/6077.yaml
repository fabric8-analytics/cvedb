cve: 2007-6077
title: CVE in org.springframework.session:spring-session-data-mongodb
description: >
    The session fixation protection mechanism in cgi_process.rb in Rails 1.2.4, as used in Ruby on Rails, removes the :cookie_only attribute from the DEFAULT_SESSION_OPTIONS constant, which effectively causes cookie_only to be applied only to the first instantiation of CgiRequest, which allows remote attackers to conduct session fixation attacks.  NOTE: this is due to an incomplete fix for CVE-2007-5380.
