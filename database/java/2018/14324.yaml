description: >
    The demo feature in Oracle GlassFish Open Source Edition 5.0 has TCP port 7676 open by default with a password of admin for the admin account. This allows remote attackers to obtain potentially sensitive information, perform database operations, or manipulate the demo via a JMX RMI session, aka a "jmx_rmi remote monitoring and control problem." NOTE: this is not an Oracle supported product.
