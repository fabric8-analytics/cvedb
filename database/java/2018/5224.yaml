description: >
    Bamboo did not correctly check if a configured Mercurial repository URI contained values that the Windows operating system may consider argument parameters.

All versions of Bamboo starting with 2.7.0 before 6.3.3 (the fixed version for 6.3.x) and from version 6.4.0 before 6.4.1 (the fixed version for 6.4.x) running on the Windows operating system are affected by this vulnerability.
