title: CVE in org.smartparam.manager:smartparam-manager-parent
description: >
    A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Unified Communications Manager could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to perform a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the web-based management interface of an affected device. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based management interface of an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the web-based management interface to click a link that is designed to submit malicious input to the interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the interface or allow the attacker to access sensitive browser-based information on the targeted device. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvg51264.
