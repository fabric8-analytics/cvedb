title: CVE in com.isotrol.impe3.tickets:impe3-tickets-jersey
description: >
    The "PayWinner" function of a simplelottery smart contract implementation for The Ethereum Lottery, an Ethereum gambling game, generates a random value with publicly readable variable "maxTickets" (which is private, yet predictable and readable by the eth.getStorageAt function). Therefore, it allows attackers to always win and get rewards.
