title: CVE in org.apache.qpid:proton-jms
description: >
    The C client and C-based client bindings in the Apache Qpid Proton library before 0.13.1 on Windows do not properly verify that the server hostname matches a domain name in the subject's Common Name (CN) or subjectAltName field of the X.509 certificate when using the SChannel-based security layer, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof servers via an arbitrary valid certificate.
