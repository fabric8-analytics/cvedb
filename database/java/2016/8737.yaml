title: CVE in Apache Brooklyn
description: >
    In Apache Brooklyn before 0.10.0, the REST server is vulnerable to cross-site request forgery (CSRF), which could permit a malicious web site to produce a link which, if clicked whilst a user is logged in to Brooklyn, would cause the server to execute the attacker's commands as the user. There is known to be a proof-of-concept exploit using this vulnerability.
