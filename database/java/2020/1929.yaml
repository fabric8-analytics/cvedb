title: CVE in org.apache.beam:beam-runners-reference-java
description: >
    The Apache Beam MongoDB connector in versions 2.10.0 to 2.16.0 has an option to disable SSL trust verification. However this configuration is not respected and the certificate verification disables trust verification in every case. This exclusion also gets registered globally which disables trust checking for any code running in the same JVM.
