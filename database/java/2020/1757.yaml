title: CVE in org.jboss.spec.javax.servlet:jboss-servlet-api_4.0_spec
description: >
    A flaw was found in all undertow-2.x.x SP1 versions prior to undertow-2.0.30.SP1, all undertow-1.x.x and undertow-2.x.x versions prior to undertow-2.1.0.Final, where the Servlet container causes servletPath to normalize incorrectly by truncating the path after semicolon which may lead to an application mapping resulting in the security bypass.
