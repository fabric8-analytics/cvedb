title: CVE in io.github.jiaozi789.tool:cherry-tool-log
description: >
    apt-get in apt before 0.7.21 does not check for the correct error code from gpgv, which causes apt to treat a repository as valid even when it has been signed with a key that has been revoked or expired, which might allow remote attackers to trick apt into installing malicious repositories.
