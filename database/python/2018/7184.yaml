title: CVE in cloudshell-traffic-virtual
description: >
    ntpd in ntp 4.2.8p4 before 4.2.8p11 drops bad packets before updating the "received" timestamp, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (disruption) by sending a packet with a zero-origin timestamp causing the association to reset and setting the contents of the packet as the most recent timestamp. This issue is a result of an incomplete fix for CVE-2015-7704.
cvss_v2: 5.0
