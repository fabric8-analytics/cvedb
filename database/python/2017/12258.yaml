title: CVE in odoo8-addon-sale-order-unified-menu
description: >
    A vulnerability in the web-based UI of Cisco Unified Communications Manager could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute a cross-frame scripting (XFS) attack. The vulnerability exists because the affected software does not provide sufficient protections for HTML inline frames (iframes). An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by directing a user of the affected software to an attacker-controlled web page that contains a malicious HTML inline frame. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to conduct click-jacking or other types of client-side browser attacks. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCve60993.
