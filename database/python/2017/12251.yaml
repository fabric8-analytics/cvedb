title: CVE in cloud
description: >
    A vulnerability in the web console of the Cisco Cloud Services Platform (CSP) 2100 could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to interact maliciously with the services or virtual machines (VMs) operating remotely on an affected CSP device. The vulnerability is due to weaknesses in the generation of certain authentication mechanisms in the URL of the web console. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by browsing to one of the hosted VMs' URLs in Cisco CSP and viewing specific patterns that control the web application's mechanisms for authentication control. An exploit could allow the attacker to access a specific VM on the CSP, which causes a complete loss of the system's confidentiality, integrity, and availability. This vulnerability affects Cisco Cloud Services Platform (CSP) 2100 running software release 2.1.0, 2.1.1, 2.1.2, 2.2.0, 2.2.1, or 2.2.2. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCve64690.
