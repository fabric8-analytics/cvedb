title: CVE in setuptools
description: >
    easy_install in setuptools before 0.7 uses HTTP to retrieve packages from the PyPI repository, and does not perform integrity checks on package contents, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted response to the default use of the product.
