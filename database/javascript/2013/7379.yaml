title: CVE in tomato
description: >
    The admin API in the tomato module before 0.0.6 for Node.js does not properly check the access key when it is set to a string, which allows remote attackers to bypass authentication via a string in the access-key header that partially matches config.master.api.access_key.
cvss_v2: 6.8
