title: CVE in csrf
description: >
    A vulnerability was discovered in all quay-2 versions before quay-3.0.0, in the Quay web GUI where POST requests include a specific parameter which is used as a CSRF token. The token is not refreshed for every request or when a user logged out and in again. An attacker could use a leaked token to gain access to the system using the user's account.
