"Symantec System Center Impact

Symantec System Center (SSS) is a Microsoft Management Console (MMC) plug-in which allows an administrator to manage all Symantec AntiVirus platforms from a single, centralized location. Alert Management System 2 (AMS2) is an alerting feature of System Center that listens for specific events and sends notifications as specified by the administrator.

AMS2 is installed by default with Symantec System Center 9.0. AMS2 is an optional component in Symantec System Center 10.0 or 10.1. These vulnerabilities will only impact systems if AMS has been installed.

Symantec AntiVirus Server Impact

AMS2 is installed by default with Symantec AntiVirus Server 9.0. AMS2 is an optional component in Symantec AntiVirus Server 10.0 or 10.1. These vulnerabilities will only impact systems if AMS has been installed.

Symantec AntiVirus and Symantec Endpoint Protection Central Quarantine Server Impact

AMS2 is installed by default by Central Quarantine Server. These vulnerabilities will only impact systems if Quarantine Server has been installed.

Symantec is not aware of any customers impacted by these issues, or of any attempts to exploit them. However, we recommend that any affected customers update their product immediately to protect against potential attempts to exploit these issues.

Certain localized language versions of SCS 2.0/SAV 9.x were not patched due to compatibility issues on the localized platforms. As a result, customers who are running the following versions are strongly recommended to update to a non-vulnerable SCS 2.0/SAV 9 International English version or upgrade to a non-vulnerable version of SEP 11.x:

Symantec Client Security 2.0/Symantec AntiVirus Corporate Edition 9.x (Chinese Simplified and Chinese Traditional)
Symantec Client Security 2.0/Symantec AntiVirus Business Pack 9.x (Chinese Simplified and Chinese Traditional)
Symantec Client Security 2.0/Symantec AntiVirus Business Pack 9.x (Korean)
Symantec Client Security 2.0/Symantec AntiVirus Business Pack 9.x (Japanese licensed)"
