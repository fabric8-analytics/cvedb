title: CVE in charset
description: >
    charset 1.0.0 and below are vulnerable to regular expression denial of service. Input of around 50k characters is required for a slow down of around 2 seconds. Unless node was compiled using the -DHTTP_MAX_HEADER_SIZE= option the default header max length is 80kb, so the impact of the ReDoS is relatively low.
