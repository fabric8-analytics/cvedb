description: >
    elding is a simple web server. elding is vulnerable to a directory traversal issue, allowing an attacker to access the filesystem by placing "../" in the url. The files accessible, however, are limited to files with a file extension. Sending a GET request to /../../../etc/passwd, for example, will return a 404 on etc/passwd/index.js.
