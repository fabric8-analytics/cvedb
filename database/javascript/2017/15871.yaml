title: CVE in serialize-js-model
description: >
    ** DISPUTED ** The deserialize function in serialize-to-js through 1.1.1 allows attackers to cause a denial of service via vectors involving an Immediately Invoked Function Expression "function()" substring, as demonstrated by a "function(){console.log(" call or a simple infinite loop. NOTE: the vendor agrees that denial of service can occur but notes that deserialize is explicitly listed as "harmful" within the README.md file.
