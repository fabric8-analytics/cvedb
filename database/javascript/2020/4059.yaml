    In mversion before 2.0.0, there is a command injection vulnerability. This issue may lead to remote code execution if a client of the library calls the vulnerable method with untrusted input. This vulnerability is patched by version 2.0.0. Previous releases are deprecated in npm. As a workaround, make sure to escape git commit messages when using the commitMessage option for the update function.
