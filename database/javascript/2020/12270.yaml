title: CVE in react-native-zdh-bluetooth
description: >
    ** DISPUTED ** React Native Bluetooth Scan in Bluezone 1.0.0 uses six-character alphanumeric IDs, which might make it easier for remote attackers to interfere with COVID-19 contact tracing by using many IDs. NOTE: the vendor disputes the relevance of this report because the recipient of an F1 alert will know it was a false alert if this recipient is not actually part of the contact history obtained from the device of an F0.
cvss_v2: 3.3
